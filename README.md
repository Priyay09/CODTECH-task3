OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Project: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)
Objective: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI focused on enabling
computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This
task involves working on a specific NLP problem, such as sentiment
analysis or text classification.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is indeed an exciting field of AI, with numerous applications such as sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity recognition, machine translation, and more. Let's walk through the process of working on a specific NLP problem—sentiment analysis—step by step.

Step 1: Define the Problem
For sentiment analysis, the goal is to classify text (e.g., reviews, tweets) into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Step 2: Data Collection
Gather Data: Collect a dataset relevant to the problem. For sentiment analysis, popular datasets include the IMDB movie reviews dataset, Twitter sentiment datasets, and Amazon reviews.
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Remove or normalize unwanted characters, punctuation, numbers, and stop words.
Tokenization: Split text into individual words or tokens.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their base or root form.
Text Vectorization: Convert text into numerical format using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
Step 4: Model Selection
Choose appropriate models for text classification. Common models include:

Traditional Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Deep Learning Models: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
Step 5: Model Training
Train the chosen models on the preprocessed data.

Step 6: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Step 7: Model Tuning and Optimization
Tune hyperparameters and optimize the models to improve performance.

Step 8: Deployment
Deploy the best-performing model into a production environment.
